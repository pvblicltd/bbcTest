## Supplied Brief

Please create a page (or a “widget” that we can embed into other pages) where a user can view their profile picture, upload a new picture to change it, or set their picture back to default.

## Process

1. Created Github repo, set up the README.MD and .gitignore
2. Set up local virtual hosts for dev, one for app src and one for dist *same project root 
3. Set up node package.json, bower.json, .bowerc. I have added the packagaes and libs I know I will need however this will probabaly get added to, I will explain all the packages at the end of the test
4. Installed vendor packages via bower.json, doing a commit to show vendor packages
5. Set up initial gruntfile, added asset folders to app-src and dist *grunt gernerates the dist assets
